                  Note on Mac support for Problem Set 1
                               Spring 2015

   Problem Set 1 makes use of the system grep utility.

   It was designed for use with a GNU system (GNU grep) and the
   initial implementation of (r:repeat) relies on an undocumented GNU
   extension in grep.

   This "subtle bug" is the topic of Problem 1.2. Problem 1.2d
   involves rewriting (r:repeat) to use a different approach that
   conforms to the POSIX standard.

----

Problem:

    Mac OS X includes a slightly different version of grep (BSD
    grep).

    Thus, the initial (r:repeat) implementation provided will not
    execute correctly on a Mac until it is fixed in problem 1.2d.

    Specifically, you will find that any call to (r:grep) expression
    including (r:repeat) will yield a grep error that will appear as
    r:grep returning #f rather than the matching lines.

----

Resolution:

(1) The simplest resolution to get r:grep fully working on Mac and
    complete the rest of the problem set is to just fix (r:repeat) by
    understanding and completing problem 1.2d, and ignore any
    erroneous behavior arising from using (r:repeat) in the initial
    code/examples.

(2) The other option is to install GNU grep so that the system and
    examples work as provided. GNU grep is available from
    http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/grep/.

    The standard "./configure; sudo make install" worked on my Mac and
    installed the GNU grep in /usr/local/bin/grep. Rather than messing
    with the emacs/scheme shell PATH, I manually replaced the "grep"
    command with "/usr/local/bin/grep" in the command-string and
    r:grep* definitions.

    "grep --version" will display which grep you have installed
