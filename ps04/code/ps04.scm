It looks like when we start the game, our avatar has a health of 3. Once that health drops to 0 (two troll bites), we die. A troll attacks with a coin flip. I want to scale health to be [0, 1] and initialized at full health (1 meaning 100% health). I don't really want to deal with floating point or roundoff errors, so I am going to scale this to be [0, 10]. Additionally, we will implement a health growth system that increases health by 1 with each tick, but iff health is less than 10 (you cannot exceed 100% health).

Note: I changed the actual files adventure-object and adventure-world. I will include a copy of the code changed below.
|#


;; health gets initialized to 10 instead of 3
(define person:health
  (make-property 'health
                 'predicate n:exact-integer?
                 'default-value 10))
;; when a troll bites a person, it can be a random number in 10
(define (eat-people! troll)
  (if (flip-coin (get-hunger troll))
      (let ((people (people-here troll)))
        (if (n:null? people)
            (narrate! (list (possessive troll) "belly rumbles")
                      troll)
            (let ((victim (random-choice people)))
              (narrate! (list troll "takes a bite out of" victim)
                        troll)
              (suffer! (random-number 10) victim))))))
;; healing a person with each clock tick!
(define (heal-person! person)
  (let ((current-health (get-health person)))
    (if (< current-health 10)
        (begin
          (set-health! person (+ current-health 1))
          (say! person (list "I am healing! I can now take" (get-health person) "bites!"))))))
(define-clock-handler person? heal-person!)

For this, I am going to make MIT Medical as some entity that is above the green building but and south of the gates tower. I need to add it as a place, add the ways to exit, add line-of-sight, AND add the healing mechanism.

I want to set it up so each person starts with $5 when initialized. I will place vending machines in lobby 7 and 10. Then, if there is a vending machine, a person can buy 1 unit of health (out of 10) for $1 using a function called pay! This function will need to check if there is a vending machine in the location, the person's balance, and the person's health. I am going to assume that you cannot exceep 100% health. Lastly, I want each person to accrue money at an interest rate of 10% per tick.

I think it would be cool if we can fight a troll or other people. If fighting a troll, you have a 50% chance of winning. If you win, the troll dies and youy lose 10% of health. If you lose, nothing happens to the troll and you die.

If you fight another person in the world, then it comes down to has the higher health. The person with higher health wins and again loses 10% of health. If they have the same health, they both lose 10%. The loser will die. To make this incentive, the winner will also rob the loser and take their wallet.

I had an absurd amount of fun going around and fighting people. Even though it doesn't show in the examples I added, I actually lost a lot haha. This works really well! I may go back and update how the money collects interest, because the decimals are a bit annoying. But this would entail scaling the vending machine amounts like I did health, which would make the prices a little unrealistic, so I am not mad about keeping it this way.
